# Going to Breakfast with Ryan

Welcome to the "Going to Breakfast with Ryan" website repository! This project is a whimsical collection of memes and stories centered around the legendary event of going to breakfast with our friend Ryan, who, despite being the mastermind behind the breakfast plan, managed to not show up. But fear not, for Ryan's absence has birthed a club dedicated to the art of breakfasting with him—virtually, of course!

## Introduction

Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, Ryan organized a breakfast with several developers. However, in a plot twist worthy of a sitcom, Ryan didn't attend. We took a group picture, and in true Ryan fashion, he later photoshopped himself into it. Thus, the "Breakfast with Ryan" club was born—a place where you can enjoy the hilarity of Ryan's virtual presence at breakfasts he never attended.
